This project is powered by love2d, an awesome game library for Lua. To run it, you'll need love2d installed; you can get it from http://love2d.org.
Then you just need to double-click the .love file (if there is one at this point) or drag the whole folder to the love executable or application. There'll be a standalone executable/application when it's finished.
This game is being made by me and two other people (who I guess could be classified as the creative director, the artist and the programmer) EDIT: VitruvianSasquatch is the artist/programmer. Just for clarification...
Thanks to BlackBulletIV for the immensely useful library 'strong'! (github.com/BlackBulletIV/strong)
